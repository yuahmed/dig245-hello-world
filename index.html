        <h3>About Me:</h3>

        <ol>

            <li>
                I am Yumna Ahmed, a junior. My majors are Computer Science and Digital & Screen Media.
            </li>


            <li>
                I am really interested in front-end development as a career path after graduation. 
                <br>
                    Also, merging creativity with my technical skills has always been something I love doing.
                </br>
            </li>


            <li>I have taken multiple courses that have covered programming in various languages extensively. 
                <br>
                    Fun fact: waaaaay back in grade 6 and 7, we used to create HTML webpages for fun about random topics as part of our IT class! 
                <br> 
            </li>


            <li>
                Goals: I really want to know the fundamentals of web design and have a full understanding of the mechanics. 
                <br> I think this class is essential as I begin exploring what I would like to do for my capstone project. </br>
