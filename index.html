        <h1> Hello World! </h1>
        <h3>About Me:</h3>

        <ol>

            <li>
                I am Yumna Ahmed, a junior. My majors are Computer Science and Digital & Screen Media.

                I am really interested in front-end development as a career path after graduation.
                Also, merging creativity with my technical skills has always been something I love doing.
            </li>


            <li>
                I have taken multiple courses that have covered programming in various languages extensively.Fun fact: waaaaay back in grade 6 and 7, we used to create HTML webpages for fun about random topics as part of our IT class! 
            </li>


            <li>
                Goals: I really want to know the fundamentals of web design and have a full understanding of the mechanics.
                    I think this class is essential as I begin exploring what I would like to do for my capstone project.

                Chosen learn-computing activity: NETWORKS.
                <p>
                    This activity provides information about networks and explains how users are connected to the internet, and how the internet is connected.
                    An IP address is used to identify devices connected to the internet and is unique. Currently, IPv6 is in use. A domain name is the human-readable
                    equivalent of an IP address and browsers have the functionality to perform a DNS lookup to find the corresponding IP address and fetch data accordingly.
                    The activity then explains some useful CLI terminology - for example, upon using the <b>ping</b> command I saw that my laptop connected to <i>google.com in ~11ms, 
                    </i> to <i>davidson.edu in ~4ms</i> and to <i>amazon.com in ~24ms</i>. I think this is because of my distance to the servers of each domain physically - Davidson is fastest since 
                    I am on campus. Meanwhile, the <b>netstat -at</b> command showed that I had more than 20+ connections to/from my laptop. I did not understand a lot of these, but saw
                    a few that said <i>papercut</i> which I believe are connections for the pawprint printer setup on my laptop.

                        <a href="https://www.termsandconditions.game/"> Terms and Conditions:</a> I played this game and found it to be highly interesting. The questions and design reflected how some
                        websites/ apps today genuinely make it very hard to opt out of data collection practices. This was particularly enlightening and showcases a real world issue about deceptive practices.

                        <a href="https://spotthetroll.org/start">Spot the Troll:</a> This website is highly relevant to the modern day. We live in the midst of infinite sources of misinformation, and this 
                        website provides info about signs that can help you know whether a source is legit or not. I think an upgrade to this could be updating it with pointers relevant to today - for example, 
                        using a female in the profile picture is now very commonly known as a illegitimate source, causing misinformers to come up with new tactics.

                        <a href="https://neal.fun/size-of-space/"> The Size of Space:</a> I found this website particularly interesting at it provides a visual example of how big the 
                        known universe really is. Truly mind blowing, and I think it is a really nifty website that provides a useful comparison.

                This assignment was fun, and a nice way to learn basic HTML. Initially I struggled with structuring the text properly in a presentabe manner, but eventually figured it out.
                I wanted to add more touches and experiment with the code, but discovered that a lot of HTML4 tags are now not in use and instead CSS or inline CSS is used. Definitely something to keep in mind.
